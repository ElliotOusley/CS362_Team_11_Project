A high-level description. What does the system do and why would a user want to use it.
How to install the software. If your system has prerequisites (e.g., tools, libraries, emulators, third-party applications, etc.), your instructions should list all of them and indicate how to install and configure them. Make sure to indicate what specific version requirements these prerequisites must satisfy. If running the system requires the installation of, e.g., a virtual machine, a database, or an emulator, make sure to provide clear step-by-step instructions.
How to run the software. How to start up the system?
How to use the software. You can assume that your user is familiar with your particular platform (e.g., use of a Web browser, desktop applications, or mobile applications). For missing functionality, your documentation should simply indicate that this functionality is work in progress.
How to report a bug. This should include not just the mechanics (a pointer to your issue tracker), but also what information is needed. You can set up a bug-report template in your issue tracker, or you can reference a resource about how to write a good bug report. Here is an example for bug reporting guidelinesLinks to an external site..
Known bugs. Known bugs or limitations should be documented in the bug tracker. A user testing the implemented use case(s) should not encounter trivial bugs (e.g., NPEs) or a large number of bugs that are unlisted in your bug tracker.

# Description:
Codequest is a puzzle role playing game that teaches programming through rpg mechanics like battles and puzzles. In this game, the player makes progress through
completing puzzles in which they drag text blocks to answer questions and complete partial code snippets. 
This game is aimed at users who are new to programming, or those who would like an overview of programming in general.

# Installation Instructions (Work In Progress):
CodeQuest can be installed from our [itch.io page](https://elliot-ousley.itch.io/codequest?secret=jcvzabSa7tMD79NWAInWcEflRc)
(Links to a draft page). On the page, scroll down to the downloads section and select the windows version. Once downloaded, unzip the file in a folder of your choice.

# Bug Reporting
We use **GitHub Issues** for bug reporting: [Issues Page](https://github.com/ElliotOusley/CS362_Team_11_Project/issues)

**Guidelines to follow:**
- **Title**: Use a short description of the bug.  
- **Steps to Reproduce**: List them clearly so we can recreate the issue.  
- **Expected vs. Actual Results**: State what you expected to happen and what actually happened.  
- **Environment Details**: Include your operating system, Godot version, or binary version.  

We follow the [Mozilla Bug Writing Guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_Writing_Guidelines). Key points:

1. **Clear Summary**: A concise, 1-line summary of the issue.  
2. **Precise Steps**: How to make it happen every time, if possible.  
3. **Expected vs Actual Results**: Distinguish between what should happen and what did.  
4. **Additional Info**: Screenshots, logs, or crash dumps help us fix the bug faster.
