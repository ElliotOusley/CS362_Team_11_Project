A high-level description. What does the system do and why would a user want to use it.
How to install the software. If your system has prerequisites (e.g., tools, libraries, emulators, third-party applications, etc.), your instructions should list all of them and indicate how to install and configure them. Make sure to indicate what specific version requirements these prerequisites must satisfy. If running the system requires the installation of, e.g., a virtual machine, a database, or an emulator, make sure to provide clear step-by-step instructions.

How to use the software. You can assume that your user is familiar with your particular platform (e.g., use of a Web browser, desktop applications, or mobile applications). For missing functionality, your documentation should simply indicate that this functionality is work in progress.
How to report a bug. This should include not just the mechanics (a pointer to your issue tracker), but also what information is needed. You can set up a bug-report template in your issue tracker, or you can reference a resource about how to write a good bug report. Here is an example for bug reporting guidelinesLinks to an external site..
Known bugs. Known bugs or limitations should be documented in the bug tracker. A user testing the implemented use case(s) should not encounter trivial bugs (e.g., NPEs) or a large number of bugs that are unlisted in your bug tracker.
